## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ i'm Stanley Garrett III


I am currently a bootcamp student at TripleTen, transitioning from a career in the fashion industry to software engineering. After nine months in the program, Iâ€™ve already gained proficiency in HTML, CSS, the command line, VS Code, Flex-box, Grid, and much more. As I continue to dive deeper into JavaScript, React, Python, and other technologies, Iâ€™m excited about the new skills Iâ€™m acquiring. The progress Iâ€™ve made so far reinforces my decision to pivot into tech, and I look forward to building a fulfilling career in this dynamic field. This journey has ignited a passion for my love in coding and other technologies shaping it to create something new. Would love to chat and connect with anyone in the field. Always open to learning and any opportunity to help me get a foot in the door.
